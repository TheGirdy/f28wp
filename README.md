## This README file will explain each of my commits for the coursework.

## Week 2 - WebProgramming1 folder.
### *Note - this code was written in Java as I had recently gotten a new computer and had various issues related to both using Ecclipse and installing VisualStudio, which is were I currently write my code. 
### HelloWorld.java - this program was simply created to test if I had correctly linked my GitHub. This program simply displays a message of 'Hello World' when run.  
### BasicCalculator.java - this is, as the name suggests, a very simple calculator that takes in 2 user inputted numbers along with a user inputted calculation (+, -, *, /) and solves it. 
### DiceRoll.java - this is a program that will ask the user to input a number of dices that they want to roll and will then roll the dices and display the results.

## Week 3-6 - Week 3 folder.
### * I intended to create a folder for each weeks submission but then promptly forgot around week 4, so there are multiple weeks worth of work in this folder.
### Index.html - I decided to test using buttons and functions. I spent hours using buttons to create dynamic webpages and then decided to submit a program that will change the font colour of a button when clicked, I also made a button that would reset the changes made when the button was first clicked. 
### script.js - this code was provided in a lecture and was used to create a table of a random size that would display many different colours. 
### testing.html - this code was used to create a navigation bar that I then spent time testing and changing. 
### styles.css - this was an external stylesheet that would change the properties of the nav bar in the testing.html page. 

## Week 6-12 - Week 6 folder.
### * As mentioned above, I had intended to create a new folder for each week to document each weeks coursework. However after making the Week 6 folder, I decided to put all further work there.
### JQueryPractice.html - After discussing JQuery in a lecture I decided to do some experimenting with it myself. This code was used to show this. I made functions using JQuery that would change the fontsize of a button when clicked. A function that would then change back the fontsize when clicked again. A function that change the colour of a button when the mouse hovered over it and then a button that would change it back when the mouse left the button. 
### bold.html - this code made each word in the page bold, it implemented script.js to do this.
### script.js - this code used JQuery to make each word on the bold.html page bold, I did need some help with this code and managed to find it online. 
### calculator.html - this code created an interactive calculator that would take in user input and display it within the page. It would then dynamically update to show the correct answer from the calculation. This coursework took a few weeks to complete. 
### javascript.js - this code was used in the calulator.html page and was used to update the page when the user clicked on specific buttons. There were some issues however and the javascript.js file was added into the calculator.html page directling using <script>.
### styles.css - this code was used in the calculator.html page and was used to create the calulator frame and display the buttons. 
### clock.html - this code was used to create a clockface that would show the current time in the UK. This code took a few weeks to get working correctly. 
### clockScript.js - this code was used in the clock.html page and was used to get the current time and update the clock hands on the clockface. 
### clockStyles.cc - this code was used in the clock.html page and was used to create the clockface along with the time intervals and the clock-hands. 
### countdown.html - this code would create a countdown timer. The user would provide a date ( I chose Christmas Day) and the program would count down until that date. 
### progressBar.html - this code would create a progress bar that would update when the user clicked a button. 
### worldClock.html - this code would find the time for any timezone in the world. It would ask the user to input a country or city and would then display the current time in that place. This code was worked on in the background for a number of weeks.
